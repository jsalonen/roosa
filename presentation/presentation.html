# Overview

- Introduction
- Overview of the design approach
- Small examples
- Walkthrough of a more complete example illustrating the use of the technology
- Evaluation (benefits, drawbacks, general usefulness of the approach, possible measurements, ...)
- Summary

# Introduction

- RDF (Resource Description Framework). Official W3C recommendation for Semantic Web data models.
- A graph-based data model. Data is organized in triples in *subject-predicate-object* format.
- Resources are identified with URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers)
- Distributed, reifiable
- Serialization formats: RDF/XML, N3, Turtle
- Data models are often persisted with specialized triplestores
- Reasoners and rule engines can be added on top. There is also OWL (Web Ontology Language).

# RDF Modeling Example (1/2)

Let's model *"John is knows Mary"* in RDF.

Triples:

    <http://example.com/people#John>
        <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title>
            "John"

    <http://example.com/people#John>
        <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows>
            <http://example.com/people#Mary>.

Graph visualization:

# RDF Modeling Example (2/2)

RDF/XML serialization:

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
      xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
      xmlns:foaf="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">
      <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.com/people#John">
        <dc:title>John</dc:title> 
        <foaf:knows rdf:resource="http://example.com/people#Mary"/>
      </rdf:Description>
    </rdf:RDF>

N3:

    @prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>.
    @prefix dc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/>.
    @prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>.
    <http://example.com/people#John> dc:title "John";
        foaf:knows <http://example.com/people#Mary>.
 
Note: just like in N3, prefixes are commonly used to simplify representations
(full URIs can still be resolved).

# Overview of the design approach

- RDF models are commonly accessed with native APIs and SPARQL query interfaces. Problems:
 - Native APIs are bound to specific technologies (often Java) -> tight coupling
 - SPARQL is standardized, but query-oriented
- Our approach was to implement a RESTful API for accessing RDF data:
 - Organize triples into resources
 - Manipulate the underlying graph by using standard HTTP verbs and resources

# Results

- Open source RESTful RDF server
- Implemented with Python, Flask and rdflib
- Right now only supports JSON
- Also added unit testing
- For demonstration purposes, implemented a JavaScript client for managing and browsing the graph
(on top of Arbor.js)

Let's make a short walkthrough

---

# Examples

To demonstrate the server, we loaded it with W3C's Wine Ontology, a well known example OWL
ontology: <http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/wine.rdf>

Start the server:

    `python app.py`

Runs on `localhost:8080`. Check frontpage.

---

# Examples: REST API Methods (1/2)

**HTTP GET**

    curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/instances/vin:Foxen

    200 OK

    {"data": [["rdf:type", "vin:Winery"]],
     "backlinks": [["vin:FoxenCheninBlanc", "vin:hasMaker"],
     ["_:ESouuNdS435", "rdf:first"]]}

**HTTP DELETE**

    curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/instances/vin:Winery

    200 Deleted

---

# Example: REST API Methods (2/2)

`foxen2.json`:

    {"data": [["rdf:type", "vin:Winery"]],
     "backlinks": [["vin:FoxenCheninBlanc", "vin:hasMaker"]]}

**HTTP PUT**

    curl -v -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    -X POST --data "@foxen2.json"
    http://localhost:8080/api/instances/vin:Foxen2

    200 OK

---

# Proof-of-concept JavaScript Client

- Implemented with JavaScript, jQuery and arbor.js
- Uses JSON data from the server
- Can be used to managing and browsing the graph:
 - Shows a part of the graph 
 - Leafnodes are hyperlinks to other parts of the graph
 - To add subjects, predicates and objects (POST or PUT)
 - To delete subjects, predicates and objects (DELETE)

---

# Evaluation

Successfully created REST API and example client

- Basic RDF model manipulation via standard HTTP methods (GET, PUT, DELETE)
  - Any client supporting them can use the API
  - We did not (yet) implement POST or PATCH
- Resource-oriented way to access RDF models

---

# Evaluation - Issues to be Resolved

- Does not fully support RDF model. Matters to be resolved:
 - Support for full URIs (only `prefix:name` works right now)
 - Prefix management interface (find to what URIs prefixies are bound to)
 - Blank node and reification support
- Complex queries should be done with SPARQL (SPARQL API also needed)
- Performance. It has been only preliminarily tested
- Some bugs related to arbor.js 
- We should also see how we relate to [SPARQL 1.1 Graph Store HTTP Protocol](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-http-rdf-update/)

---

# Summary

- Successfully implemented RESTful RDF server and example client
- There is still work to be done, but it all looks very promising
- Client is useful for viewing and creating RDF models
- Actual queries to the RDF database should be done with query language
